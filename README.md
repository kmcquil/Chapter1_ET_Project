# Chapter 1: Forest water use sensitivity to drought and climate using multi-sensor RS based ET
 This repository contains all scripts used in Chapter 1 analysis. 
 
We used a multi-sensor remote sensing approach combining Landsat and MODIS ET to investigate interactions between forest composition, climate, and topography on ET response to water availability. We quantified pixel-wise average drought ET responses, the correlation of ET with water availability, and trends in the strength of correlations between ET and water availability over time in the Blue Ridge ecoregion of the southeastern USA.
